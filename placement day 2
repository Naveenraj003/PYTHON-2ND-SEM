a=[]
n=int(input("no.of entries: "))
for k in range(0,n):
    b=int(input())
    a.append(b)
print(a)
l= a[0]
s= a[0]
for num in a:
    if num > l:
        l = num
    if num < s:
        s = num

3.  Write a program to find the second largest and second smallest number in the list without using the in-built function.

a=[]
n=int(input("no.of entries: "))
for k in range(0,n):
    b=int(input())
    a.append(b)
print(a)
max_num = min_num = a[0]
second_max = second_min = a[0]

for num in a:
    if num > max_num:
        second_max = max_num
        max_num = num
    elif num < min_num:
        second_min = min_num
        min_num = num

print(f"Second largest number: {second_max}")
print(f"Second smallest number: {second_min}")

4. Write a program to sort elements stored in the list as Ascending order and Descending order without using the in-built function (sort ()).                
Eg: [5,3,7,9,8,4,2]
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,8,9] – Ascending Order, 
	  [9,8,7,5,4,3,2] – Descending Order


a=[]
n=int(input("no.of entries: "))
for k in range(0,n):
    b=int(input())
    a.append(b)
print(a)
for i in range(len(a)):
    for j in range(0, len(a)-i-1):
        if a[j] > a[j+1]:
            a[j], a[j+1] = a[j+1], a[j]

print("Ascending Order:", a)
for i in range(len(a)):
    for j in range(0, len(a)-i-1):
        if a[j] < a[j+1]:
            a[j], a[j+1] = a[j+1], a[j]

print("Descending Order:", a)


5. Find the index position of the specific number stored in the list.
Eg: a= [45,67,83,24,55,87,77,34]
What is the position of 55?


a=[]
n=int(input("no.of entries: "))
for k in range(0,n):
    b=int(input())
    a.append(b)
print(a)
num = int(input("Enter the number to find its position: "))
if num in a:
    index = a.index(num)
    print(f"The position of {num} in the list is: {index}")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not in the list.")

6. Find most frequent element present in a list.
Eg: a= [4,5,6,4,6,7,4,2,4,8,4]
Output: 4


from collections import Counter
user_list = input("Enter elements of the list separated by spaces: ").split()
element_count = Counter(user_list)
most_common_element = max(element_count, key=element_count.get)
print(f"The most frequent element in the list is: {most_common_element}")


7. Below are the two lists. Write a Python program to convert them into a dictionary in a way that item from list1 is the key and item from list2 is the value by using update method ().
keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]
Output:
{'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}



keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

result_dict = {}
for key, value in zip(keys, values):
    result_dict.update({key: value})

print(result_dict)


8. Create a list of 10 members as a Voter_list. Assume that there are 3 Candidates (A, B & C) are going to contest in the election process. Write a program that voters will cast their votes and predict the Winner and Runner of the election process and to find the members who voted for the Winner and Runner.



p=[]
n=int(input("No of peoples voting: "))
for j in range(0,n):
    h=input("Voters name: ")
    p.append(h)
print(f"Voters Name: {p}")
k=[]
r=[]
d=[]
n=[]
for i in p:
    v=int(input(f"MR.{i}:press: 1 for Kohli,2 for Virat,3 for Dhoni,4 for nota:\n "))
    if v==1:
        k.append(i)
    elif v==2:
        r.append(i)
    elif v==3:
        d.append(i)
    elif v==4:
        n.append(i)
    else:
        print("invalid vote")
print(f"Voters Name: {p}")
a=len(k)
b=len(r)
c=len(d)
d=len(n)
if a>b and a>c and a>d:
    print(f"KOHLI won the election\nby {a}votes from: {k}")
    print(f"ROHITH lose the election with {b} votes and DHONI lose the election with {c} votes")
elif b>a and b>c and b>d:
    print(f"ROHITH won the election\nby {b}votes from: {r}")
    print(f"KOHLI lose the election with {d} votes and DHONI lose the election with {c} votes")
elif c>b and c>a and c>d:
    print(f"DHONI won the election\nby {c}votes from: {d}")
    print(f"ROHITH lose the election with {b} votes and KOHLI lose the election with {a} votes")
elif d>b and d>c and d>a:
    print(f"{d} Votes for NOTA\nMaximum people votes for NOTA")





9. Write a program to calculate the following functions:
	1. India (Rupee) to US (Dollar) conversion
	2. Celsius to Fahrenheit
	3. BMI Calculation
	4. Simple Interest Calculation




def inr_to_usd(amount):
    exchange_rate = 0.014
    usd_amount = amount * exchange_rate
    return usd_amount
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    bmi = weight / ((height/100) ** 2)
    return bmi
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
    return interest
print("INR to USD:", inr_to_usd(1000))
print("Celsius to Fahrenheit:", celsius_to_fahrenheit(25))
print("BMI:", calculate_bmi(70, 170))
print("Simple Interest:", calculate_simple_interest(1000, 5, 2))


10. Write a program to get 0s and 1s in the list:

def sort_zeros_ones(input_list):
    zeros = input_list.count(0)
    sorted_list = [0] * zeros + [1] * (len(input_list) - zeros)
    return sorted_list

input_list = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
output_list = sort_zeros_ones(input_list)
print(output_list)
